## Installation

1. The first thing we need to do is edit our schemes. Schemes are saved to the `.swiftpm` directory, but should not be committed to your repository, as it requires configuration specific to your local machine. 
    a. First, add a working directory to the scheme. (add link)
    b. Next, update your Launch Arguments for the scheme to pass `--env local`.
