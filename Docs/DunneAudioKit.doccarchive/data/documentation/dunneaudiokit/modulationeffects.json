A short delay line is used (up to 10 ms for flanger, or 24 ms for chorus), and the delay time is modulated using a low-frequency oscillator (LFO). Feedback is always used for flanging, typically not for chorus. There is also a wet\/dry mix setting, which will normally be 50\/50 for flanging. Setting the mix to 100% wet (for either effect) produces vibrato."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The code here is all original; none of Pirkle’s code has been used."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"These are both stereo effects (stereo-in, stereo-out).
